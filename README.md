# THIS IS NOT THE END

**Be a Pro of PHP:** keep working with [PHP](https://github.com/simplonco/php-training) and [Symfony](https://github.com/simplonco/symfony-training), try to run it on [Facebook HHVM](http://hhvm.com/) :elephant:!

**Learn JS Frameworks:** like [Google AngularJS](https://angular.io/) or [Facebook React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

**Pimp your workspace (and looks like a Hacker):** use [i3 windows manager](http://i3wm.org/) and [Zsh shell](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/zsh)!

**Try other Linux distributions:** like the simple, lightweight distribution [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) which [Keep It Simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).

**Practice your logic:** do online challenges, to earn point on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) and [Code in Game](https://www.codingame.com)!

**Be a Git Ninja:** take the time to read the whole [Git Pro Book](http://git-scm.com/book) if you don't feel confortable with Git.

**Learn other languages:** like the [C](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/) to understand memory management and strong explicit typing or [Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) to discover the magical world of pure functionnal programming!

**Studing Algorithms:** if you don't be afraid by a bit of maths, I advice you to read [the really great book of Jeff Erickson of Illinois University](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/).
